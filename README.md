-Average math score

-Average reading score

-Percentage of students who passed math

-Percentage of students who passed reading

-Overall passing percentage

-Total school budget

-School budget per capita

## Summary

Given that the reading and math scores of 9th graders at Thomas High School did not account for a large portion of the overall data, most of the results of the analysis before and after correcting these scores remains the same. The district summary above shows a .1% decrease in the average math scores, a .2% decrease in the percentage of students passing math, a .3% decrease in the percentage of students passing reading, and a .1% decrease in the percentage of students overall passing. 

In the school summary, the only impact of correcting the data was on Thomas High School. The most significant impacts of the correction include a .3% reduction in the percentage of students passing reading, as well as a reduction in the percentage of students overall from 90.94% to 90.63%.
